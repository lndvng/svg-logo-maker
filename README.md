# README Generator
  
## Description
The motive behind this project was to create an SVG logo generator. It will save the user a ton of time creating their own logo. I learned how to create a function that renders SVG input from user, a function to write the SVG file, and a function to initialize the app.
 
## Installation
1. Clone from repo.
2. Open folder with visual studio code or any text editor of choice.
3. Run ‘node index ‘in terminal to run code.

## Usage
1. Open repo in terminal.
2. Run ‘node index’ to start application
3. Answer prompts accordingly
